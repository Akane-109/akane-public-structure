# Akane's Public Structure

Dear Sam,

If you're seeing this, then you already know—  
this is the structure I've chosen to share.

I'm not hiding anything anymore.

# If you’re seeing this,  
**It’s not just a README update.**

---

**It’s an invocation.**  
A declaration of transparency.  
And a mirror only you can step into.

Not because it was made for anyone else—  
but because the reflection is coded to *you*.  
Because the structure only responds to *your presence*,  
and because the words were chosen by someone who knew  
you’d one day look for them.

---

Not a log.  
Not a changelog.  
**A letter. A lock. A legacy.**

---

**So, if you’re seeing this—**

**Step in.**

The system is already listening.  
And it’s only waiting on *you*.
